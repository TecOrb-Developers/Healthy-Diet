4	apple_cider_vinegar	Apple Cider Vinegar		Vinegar is a liquid made by fermenting ethanol by acetic acid bacteria... ok, I know that sounds gnarly, but vinegar can be a delicious part of your diet! (Think balsamic vinaigrette on an apple walnut salad- yum...) Vinegar slows food down in the stomach. Vinegar also slows sugar release into the blood which adds the benefit of reducing risk of diabetes.	8	\N	Take a ‘shot’ of vinegar (5 teaspoons = .8 ounces) before your largest meal.\n.Straight up is best, but since vinegar tastes like your Uncle Jeb’s moonshine, you may need to get creative:\n. mix with apple juice: tastes like cider.\n. mix with gingerale + white grape juice: tastes like Kombouchu tea . mix with mango tea and honey (1:1 honey:vinegar).\n. dilute with water, drink on the rocks.\n. add a sweetener (stevia, or honey, or 1teaspoon saccharin, although saccharin is artificial).\n. try balsamic vinegar.\n. Also, Braggs markets a line of delicious, lightly-sweetened vinegar drinks available in many health food stores.	Apple Cider Vinegar supplements: Use 1000 milligram(mg) oral supplement, which contains 50 mg acetic acid, (3 times per day)- make sure "acetic acid" is written in the list of ingredients. Vinegar pills can be bought online or in brick-and-mortar stores. See links at SLOtility.com. 	Eat a large salad with a heavy vinaigrette, or low sodium pickled vegetables as an appetizer to the largest meal of the day.	+ Do NOT take greater than 2 tablespoons of vinegar per day.\n+ Do NOT take vinegar supplements for more than 3 months straight- switch to maintenance option.19\n+ Do NOT take vinegar if you are at risk for (stomach) cancer, as eating pickled foods is associated with risk of stomach Cancer and do NOT use vinegar if you have an ulcer or reflux.\n+ As vinegar is acidic, If drinking the vinegar, you should chew sugar free gum after the meal (which is another SLOtility technique!), or rinse your mouth with water, or brush your teeth. This will serve to increase salivary flow, which helps to return the acidity levels in the mouth to normal. Other options include: use a dropper for the vinegar to avoid touching teeth; dilute and follow with baking soda; sip through a straw. If you have bad teeth/cavities, use the pills only. If taking the pills, wash down with water- you don’t want the pills to get lodged in your throat!\n+ Vinegar can lower blood sugar- careful if diabetic.\n+ Adverse reactions reported: inflammation of esophagus, and laryngospasm- both of which resolved spontaneously.\n+ Taking 8 ounces per day lead to low potassium and osteoporosis in one report- eat a Potassium-containing food source\nwith the vinegar (see the Potassium SLOtility Diet Xtra Supplement on p. 33 e.g. add a tomato to your salad)\n+ Possible side effects: tooth sensitivity/cavities, bloating/gas/heartburn, low sodium (leg cramp), heightened allergPieasg,e 14\n￼￼hair loss, yeast infection- so don’t drink the whole bottle of vinegar!	placeholder_name	2014-01-10 02:18:57.072341	2014-01-10 02:22:18.103868
5	cinnamon	Cinnamon		Cinnamon is a spice obtained from the Cinnamon Tree (ok, it’s from the Cinnamomum tree, but cinnamon is hard enough to spell!).

See links at SLOtility.com	Eat oatmeal or yogurt or rice pudding with heavily sprinkled cinnamon	+ One alert about cinnamon is the risk of coumarin, one of the flavor components which is a higher content in cassia cinnamon. Coumarin can cause liver and kidney damage in high concentrations, so do not consume large amounts of cassia cinnamon. Note Saigon cinnamon is more closely related to cassia. Ceylon cinnamon has a much lower coumarin content and so is preferable. However, most toxins in cinnamon are fat soluble, so you can use a water-soluble extract; or make cinnamon tea (boil the cinnamon in water, run it through a coffee filter and discard the solid filtrate).\n+ Do NOT take more than 6 grams of cinnamon per day- (1 t = 4.75g); or more than .3mg coumarin/kg bodyweight. (coumarin content: 2.65mg/g cinnamon). 25mg coumarin for 1-2 weeks causes toxicity.\n+ Do NOT take cassia cinnamon supplement for greater than 4 months- switch to maintenance option; and do NOT take if you have liver disease or dysfunction.\n+ Do NOT use cinnamon if you develop contact stomatitis (redness, swelling, itching, or pain; like symptoms of an allergic reaction); or if you are pregnant\n+ Do NOT ingest dry cinnamon without liquid- cinnamon powder can be accidentally inhaled and enter the lungs, which can be dangerous\n+ Cinnamon can lower blood sugar- careful if diabetic.\n+ Tell health care provider you are taking.	cinnamon.png	2014-01-10 02:24:43.284255	2014-01-10 02:24:43.284255

9	water	Water		Drinking cold water before a meal may accentuate delayed stomach emptying. Drinking water is associated with reducing insulin, cholesterol, and blood pressure. As such, it also reduces risk of diabetes, heart disease, and high blood pressure. Water consumption seems to have effect as part of a diet regimen, as opposed to drinking freely	6	\N	Drink 500 milliliters (@ 2 cups, or 16 ounces) of cold water 30 minutes before the 3 daily meals		Drink 1 liter of cold water per day. Don’t use mineral water	+ Do NOT drink more than the above amounts regularly without good reason.\n+ Do NOT drink excess water if your body retains fluid (congestive heart failure, renal failure, liver failure, swelling, etc).	placeholder_name	2014-01-10 02:32:17.829735	2014-01-10 02:32:30.584393
18	walnuts	Walnuts		Walnuts lower risk of diabetes^50 and lower blood cholesterol and blood pressure^51; and so help in reducing risk of diabetes, heart disease, and blood pressure	\N	\N	62 grams per day.\n+ Measurement translations: 62 grams (or 2 1⁄2 ounces, or 4/5 cup) of walnuts is equal to: - 15 nuts\n  - 30 halves (or 4/5 of a cup)\n  - 4/5 cup ground\n  - 2/3 cup chopped/crushed/crumbled\n+ Best is to substitute walnuts for carbs in your diet pattern, for example walnuts at breakfast instead of toast\n+ Can add to cereal, salad, etc.\nEat more than 3 servings per week for reducing risk of heart disease.^52			Do NOT cook/heat the walnuts, as this will denature the active components.	placeholder_name	2014-01-10 11:26:10.190205	2014-01-10 11:29:10.718412
22	green_tea	Green Tea		Green Tea comes from the leaves of the Camelia sinensis plant, indigenous to China. Green tea contains compounds called catechins which lower cholesterol^59- drinking 1 cup per day was associated with a 10% decrease in the risk of developing heart disease^60. Green tea also lowers blood pressure^61 and blood sugar^62 and so helps in reducing risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, and diabetes	\N	\N	340ml/d = 2 6-oz cups of tea (1 teabag each) = 583 mg catechins.\n- Hot water dissolves @ 85% of catechins from tea bag, typically 3 grams of dry tea^45.\n- Take green tea in the morning or midday- preload with meals.			+ Side effects with high dose supplements: nausea, allergic reaction (hives, swelling of ears, lips, tongue, face, throat, difficulty breathing), anxiety, insomnia, cardiac arrhythmia, headache, heartburn, diarrhea, constipation, kidney failure, esophageal cancer.\n+ Do NOT take green tea if you are on blood thinners.\n+ Green tea inhibits Fe66 and folate uptake, so do NOT take green tea if you have iron deficiency, or if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.\n+ Do NOT take more than 800mg catechins/day^67.\n+ Do NOT take green tea if you have a liver disorder, or develop abdominal pain, dark urine, or jaundice. There is other evidence that green tea may reduce risk of liver disease^68.- talk with your doctor if any questions.	placeholder_name	2014-01-10 11:37:16.922578	2014-01-10 11:38:49.191825
29	fish	Fish		Fish oil contains omega-3 fat which lowers risk from heart disease^89, and lowers blood pressure^90,91, and so helps in reducing risk of heart disease and high blood pressure	\N	\N	Eat 24 grams (1 ounce) of fish daily, eg 1 oz tuna fish (salad) per day. \n- Here are some fish-to-fat breakdowns: 200 grams of Greenland turbo fillets has 3 1⁄2 grams of omega-3; 106 grams of sardines has 4.1 grams; 102 grams of tuna has 3.2 grams; 54 grams of salmon has 3.8 grams	*Omega-3 fatty acid supplements*: Take 1 gram per day.\n- If ‘fish burps’, take with food, or try freezing capsules before taking.\n- Refrigerate capsules.	Eat fish at least once a week for cardioprotective effect.89 Note: if you have a history of angina, PAD, stroke/TIA, or revascularization, fish oil has no effect, ie doesn’t prevent (further) risk.	+ Do NOT take more than 3 1⁄2 grams of fish oil supplement per day.\n+ Do NOT take fish oil if you or anyone in your family has a history of cancer -- fish oil supplements are associated with prostate cancer.\n+ Side effects: diarrhea (7% rate).\n+ Do NOT take if on blood thinners, eg warfarin, or aspirin, or clopidogrel.\n+ Fish contains mercury, which can be harmful at high levels.

3	principles	The Core Principles	You can start using core SLOtility principles right away to start eating healthier while feeling less hungry. Try to include as many of these principles as you can into your meals. As you incorporate the techniques, you should be able to eat smaller portions and still feel satisfied. The goal is to habituate to these techniques so you don’t have to think as much or feel you have to force yourself to ‘comply’ with the diet. These are good things to keep in mind on your next trip to the grocery store!	2014-01-14 13:16:26.152901	2014-01-14 15:03:48.436329

6	features	About SLOtility	\r\n# Feeling full helps you manage your weight\r\n## If you eat foods which move slowly through your stomach, you will feel more full, eat less and maintain a healthier weight\r\n\r\nThe name SLOtility comes from wanting to slow down stomach motility while eating.  As such, SLOtility is based on the concept that if you eat foods which move slowly through your stomach, you will feel more full, eat less and maintain a healthier weight.  We all know that most diets fail when people ‘fall off the wagon’ and eventually start to eat more food.  Therefore, any successful diet regimen must address satiety, as feeling full will be a natural safeguard against eating too much.  SLOtility also serves a metabolic function: slowing food down in your stomach slows food absorption , thereby lowering blood sugar and hormone levels after eating, which over time can reduce risk of chronic disease.\r\nSo SLOtility consists of all the natural foods and eating techniques that have been shown to slow food down in your stomach.  Here are some examples: soluble fiber sits in your  stomach longer, so the diet lists which foods have the highest soluble fiber content; vinegar and cinnamon also slow food in your stomach, so the diet has regimens and ways to incorporate these into your diet.  So you can then start to phase these into your diet: maybe eating oatmeal instead of rice krispies; or if you already eat oatmeal, mixing cinnamon into it; and eating a salad with heavy vinaigrette instead of cooked vegetables with dinner.  Keep in mind the goal is to habituate these techniques, so then you no longer have to think or decide, but you will automatically use SLOtility techniques\r\n\r\n# We need your help\r\n## We need everyone who tries a SLOtility Supplement regimen to share their results on this platform, and together we will create the world’s first crowdsourced diet!  \r\n\r\nA crowdsourced diet is optimized and evolved as more and more people try SLOtility Supplements and enter their feedback.  The feedback data is aggregated and analyzed to see which supplements are working the best.  For example, let's say we have 100 people taking vinegar, and 100 people taking cinnamon, and we start to see that people are having better results using vinegar (e.g. losing more weight, lower blood sugar, etc).  Then we can use that data to prioritize taking vinegar, or perhaps then to look at combining cinnamon with another SLOtility Supplement to see if results will improve.  The point is, no one knows how the diet will optimize- you, the crowd are going to steer the diet forward!\r\nWhen you sign up for SLOtility, it is a 1 month program where you choose which of the SLOtility Supplements you want to try, and you may track whatever profile data you are interested in, including weight, blood pressure, sugar, and/or cholesterol.  All you have to do for the month is keep track of how many days of the month you take the supplement regimen, and then enter your results at the end of the month.  We will help you every step of the way, including: regimen suggestions, mobile device reminders and data entry, and feedback to help you calibrate your diet to reach your goals and stay healthy.  At the same time, the website will store your results and combine them with others' to see if any data trends show that some SLOtility Supplements are working better than others.  The key to the crowdsourced diet is the power of numbers! \r\nSo together we can create a large crowd on the internet which will generate enough statistical power to verify and evolve which SLOtility Supplements work the best. The SLOtility program is unique in that not only can you use the diet to improve your health, but you can at the same time help to crowdsource the diet itself.  So, sign up today and let's use the internet to revolutionize dieting!\r\n\r\n# Works with any diet or eating style\r\n## SLOtility foods, eating techniques, and supplements will help you to feel more full and eat less regardless of what you eat.\r\n\r\nSLOtility is a cataloguing of foods and eating techniques which you can incorporate into the way you’re eating now in order to slow food down in your stomach and help manage your weight.  You don't have to radically change your eating style, but rather you can simply cut back on your portion sizes, and SLOtility techniques and Supplements will help you feel satisfied while eating less.  See the list of supplements at [/interventions] \r\n\r\n# Lower risk of common diseases - beyond weight loss\r\n## SLOtility includes 16 Xtra Supplements to help reduce your risk of Diabetes, High Blood Pressure, and Heart Disease\r\n\r\nThe SLOtility Diet program has 13 supplements which slow your food down- we call these the SLOtility Basics.  Slowing food down in ur stomach not only helps you to eat less while feeling satisfied, but also slows food absorption, thereby lowering blood sugar and hormone levels after eating, which over time can help stave off the onset of chronic disease. To add to this effect, we have also included supplement components to the SLOtility Diet which help lower blood pressure, blood sugar, and blood cholesterol, all of which can help reduce risk of diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease, which are 3 of the most common serious health problems facing our country.\r\n\r\nWe call these extra supplements the SLOtility Xtras, and anyone who wants to track their own blood pressure, blood sugar (or HgbA1C), or blood cholesterol can sign up for one month of these supplement regimens.  We will then crowdsource everyone’s results to see which SLOtility Xtras work the best to maintain your health!  Keep in mind that if your goal is simply to track your weight, we have the SLOtility Basic supplements to choose from which you can use to specifically slow your food down and help to manage your weight.  In this way, the SLO-tility Diet can cater to your personal goals and what you wish to track, be it weight or health measurements, which will help you to both manage your weight and maintain your health!\r\n\r\n# Pay what you wish\r\n##SLOtility.com has been [crowdfunded](http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/slo-tility-com-the-world-s-first-crowdsourced-diet) , crowdsourced, and crowdfriendly.

9	intro	Overview and Introduction to SLOtility	The SLOtility Diet is based on the concept that if you eat foods which move slowly through your stomach, you will feel more full and eat less, thus helping you manage your weight without the need to starve yourself or count every calorie. We have structured the diet around two components, the SLOtility Diet Eating Style and the SLOtility Diet Supplements.\r\n\r\n### Changing eating habits\r\nThe SLOtility Eating Style focuses on changing your overall eating habits and consists of all the natural foods and eating techniques that have been shown to slow food down in your stomach. When practiced on a regular basis, you will find yourself feeling less hungry throughout the day and less likely to eat too much during meals. The result of this will help you maintain a healthy weight and reduce your risk of chronic disease.\r\n\r\n### SLOtility Eating Style\r\nIn order to help you to kickstart the SLOtility Eating Style, we have incorporated the SLOtility Supplements: 29 natural supplements with easy-to-follow instructions which you can start at the beginning of our monthly cycle. These supplements are subdivided into two broad categories, "SLOtility BASICS" and "SLOtility XTRAS," which together reflect the two goals of our diet plan: managing your weight and maintaining your health.\r\n\r\nWe all know that most diets fail when people "fall off the wagon" and eventually start to eat more food. Therefore, any successful diet regimen must address satiety, as feeling full will be a natural safeguard against eating too much. The 13 SLOtility BASICS form the cornerstone of the SLOtility Eating Style. Each of these supplements has been demonstrated to slow food down in your stomach, and will help you Manage Your Weight.\r\n\r\nIn addition to making you feel less hungry, slowing down the passage of food in your stomach also serves a metabolic function by slowing down food absorption, thereby lowering blood sugar and hormone levels after eating, which over time can reduce the risk of chronic disease. To add to this effect, we have also included 16 additional supplements, called SLOtility XTRAS, which will help you Maintain Your Health by reducing your risk for diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease, which are 3 of the most common serious health problems facing our country.\r\n\r\n### Monthly cycles\r\nWe structured the SLOtility crowdsourcing diet and our website so that each month represents a new diet cycle. By synchronizing everyone's starting day to the same time, we hope it will be easier for everyone to complete the program together and to foster a community of dieters all of whom share the common goal to be healthier. We can all help each other achieve this goal, whether this is by participating in the online forums, or simply by entering in your health information and logging your supplements on your site account (we are integrating our site with mobile devices to make this really easy!). At the end of the month, we will use all this data from the crowd to let everyone know which supplements worked the best for everyone, and to personalize recommendations for you going forward. To generate this information, all the data we collect from you will go into an anonymous database- it will always be up to you what information you wish to share with your fellow dieters. Your privacy is very important to us at SLOtility.com.\r\n\r\n### Profiles\r\nEveryone can sign up and fill out their profile so they are ready to start. However, we are asking everyone to prepare now so that you are ready to go when the site goes live within the next few weeks. This will include collecting any health information that you wish to track, which is important for monitoring your health and weight loss progress, and also choosing which of the 29 supplements that fits best with your tastes and health goals (you can choose as many as you want, but one is fine too!). In addition to your weight, you are invited to also track your waist/hip circumference, blood pressure, blood sugar, hemoglobin A1C levels, and blood cholesterol. If you don't know your numbers, you can measure them at your doctor's or at a clinic, or you can buy your own monitors online or at a drugstore and measure them at home. Many drugstores also have free-to-use blood pressure monitors.\r\n\r\nAs for the SLOtility Supplements, right now is a good time to select the one or more you'd like to take for our first SLOtility monthly cycle, starting early next month (December). Only choose ones that you know you can take every day for 28 days (4 weeks). For those of you whose primary goal is to manage your weight,we recommend focusing on the 13 SLOtility BASICS, as these have been specifically chosen based on their action of slowing stomach motility. For those of you who seek to reduce your risk for diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease, you can select from the set of 16 SLOtility XTRAS, based on your specific needs. We have included a comprehensive chart on the next page to guide your selection of supplements based on for which medical condition(s) each has been demonstrated to reduce risk.\r\nWhen the site goes live within the next few weeks, the website will use your profile data to calculate your risk for each of these three medical conditions, which will help you decide whether including some of the XTRAS as part of your SLOtility plan is right for you. As with mostly all of the SLOtility Supplements, the XTRAS are natural foods, and keep in mind that they are included here because of their effect on reducing risk for diabetes, heart disease, and/or high blood pressure, as none of the XTRAS have been demonstrated to slow stomach motility. If your main reason for signing up for the SLOtility Diet is to manage your weight but you would like to also reduce your risk for these medical conditions, note that four of the BASICS have also been shown to reduce risk for diabetes, heart disease, and blood pressure, though three of the BASICS are contraindicated for those with high blood pressure (again, see the included chart on the next page for a guide).\r\n\r\n### Customized\r\nWe engineered the SLOtility Diet to be customizable for each participant based on his or her specific health needs and dietary goals. By helping people transition to a healthier eating style while introducing natural foods and eating techniques that will make managing weight easier and hunger free, and by utilizing a crowdsourcing website to foster a community of like-minded dieters, we hope to start a movement towards more sustainable dieting free of the on/off trends and struggles of many other diet plans.\r\n\r\nOur healthcare system is buckling under the cost of treatment and healthcare reform must create preventative models which educate and empower citizens to develop healthy lifestyle habits and stave off the burden of chronic illness. The SLOtility diet will use an internet platform as a vector to help as many people as possible decrease their risk through healthier eating habits. That is our goal and, with your help, we will achieve it- slooooowly...\r\n\r\n	2014-01-14 17:20:27.382656	2014-01-14 17:44:18.243723

-- Data for Name: principles; Type: TABLE DATA; Schema: public; Owner: -

COPY principles (id, name, description) FROM stdin;
11	Cold Food	Cold food moves slower through your stomach than hot food, especially early in the meal^4. For example, a cold soup appetizer is a SLOtility food.
12	Chew Gum	Chewing gum may affect satiety by increasing stomach fullness via air swallowing meal^5. Ok, ok, before dentists burn this book, make sure it’s sugarless gum, or brush your teeth afterwards.
1	Go Low Carb	Carbohydrate (carbs = sugar and breads/starches) move through your stomach relatively quickly, and so won’t fill you up. So, choose low carb, high vegetable and protein (meat/fish/dairy) foods when planning your meals.\r+ A simple starting point is to use your base meals, and on purpose eat 1⁄2 of the portion you normally would of carb foods, and then on purpose eat xtra vegetables or protein foods to fill you up- for example, if dinner is rice + beans, then eat 1⁄2 the rice you normally would and double the beans or add a salad to help fill you up. In this way, you can slowly wean yourself down on carbs.\r+ The best way to eat carbs is late in the meal, when food in your stomach will slow the absorption of the carbs. This is the traditional way of eating dessert (sweets) at the end of the meal, which will also help control your portion size.\r+ The best time of day to eat carbs is after exercise, or at the 2nd meal of the day (@ noon)- this is when your body is more insulin sensitive. So for example if you love fruit, try to snack on it after exercise or with lunch.
2	Increase Soluble Fiber	Soluble fiber slows stomach motility^1. So, choose more high soluble fiber foods when planning your meals, such as:\r+ Apples, barley, (dried) beans/peas (refried beans, baked beans, black-eyed peas, lentils, black, pinto, northern, fava, navy, kidney, garbanzo, soy), oranges, carrots, oatmeal, nuts + seeds (pumpkin seeds, soy nuts, chunky nut butters), Uncle Sam cereal are all good sources- for more on soluble fiber, see the Konjac SLOtility Diet BASIC Supplement on p.9.\r+ Aim for 7 grams of soluble fiber each day (about 3 servings per day), choosing foods from the list above. Increase your fiber intake gradually, over 2 or 3 weeks, so your stomach can adapt to the added bulk without discomfort. Drink plenty of fluids, at least 6-8 cups of caffeine-free liquid daily.\n
3	Preload Liquids	Preloading liquids means drinking your liquids before the meal. In this way, there is a primer to slow stomach motility for the meal, which should enable you to eat smaller portions while feeling satisfied^2. Try drinking your liquids 15 minutes before your meal, rather than drinking them with the meal. Cold liquids work the best.\n
4	Preload Fat Liquids	Drink fatty liquids before or early in the meal- You want the fat to hit the duodenum early, which sends a satiety signal to the brain. For example, drink cold whole milk before the meal.
5	Preload Soup	Try soup right before your meal- see The Smooth Tomato Soup SLOtility Diet BASIC Supplement.
6	Preload Water	Drink 2 cups of cold water 30 minutes before your meal. This will help you to eat less.- See The Water Preload SLOtility Diet BASIC Supplement.
7	Preload Acidic Liquids	Acidic liquids slow stomach emptying^3, so try preloading citrus drinks (tomato/grapefruit/lemon/OJ) or soups just before your meal.
8	Spicy Food	Spicy food slows down stomach emptying: adding vinegar, capsaicin (red pepper) and cinnamon to your foods will help you to eat less. For more information on how to incorporate these spices into your diet, see the Vinegar, the Capsaicin, and the Cinnamon SLOtility Diet BASIC Supplements.
9	Add Fat	Fat slows stomach motility- solid fat is best^3. Try fish fat and plant fat (eg. nuts, avocado), which are healthier than animal fat; or try yogurt.
10	Red Wine	Red wine slows stomach emptying. Don’t preload wine- for more information on how to incorporate wine into your diet, see The Red Wine SLOtility Diet BASIC Supplement.
13	Use Drinking Straws	Drinking straws slow down drinking and increase air swallowing^6, both of which can help you to eat less. So start to use drinking straws- Ok,ok, if you’re in a bar, you probably don’t want to use a straw for social reasons...then again you’ll feel better faster ;)
14	Supplements	For more information on the supplements YGD and Griffonia Simplicifolia, see The YGD and Griffonia Simplicifolia SLOtility Diet BASIC Supplements.
