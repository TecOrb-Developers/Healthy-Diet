4 apple_cider_vinegar Apple Cider Vinegar   Vinegar is a liquid made by fermenting ethanol by acetic acid bacteria... ok, I know that sounds gnarly, but vinegar can be a delicious part of your diet! (Think balsamic vinaigrette on an apple walnut salad- yum...) Vinegar slows food down in the stomach. Vinegar also slows sugar release into the blood which adds the benefit of reducing risk of diabetes. 8 Take a ‘shot’ of vinegar (5 teaspoons = .8 ounces) before your largest meal.\n.Straight up is best, but since vinegar tastes like your Uncle Jeb’s moonshine, you may need to get creative:\n. mix with apple juice: tastes like cider.\n. mix with gingerale + white grape juice: tastes like Kombouchu tea . mix with mango tea and honey (1:1 honey:vinegar).\n. dilute with water, drink on the rocks.\n. add a sweetener (stevia, or honey, or 1teaspoon saccharin, although saccharin is artificial).\n. try balsamic vinegar.\n. Also, Braggs markets a line of delicious, lightly-sweetened vinegar drinks available in many health food stores.  Apple Cider Vinegar supplements: Use 1000 milligram(mg) oral supplement, which contains 50 mg acetic acid, (3 times per day)- make sure "acetic acid" is written in the list of ingredients. Vinegar pills can be bought online or in brick-and-mortar stores. See links at SLOtility.com.  Eat a large salad with a heavy vinaigrette, or low sodium pickled vegetables as an appetizer to the largest meal of the day.  + Do NOT take greater than 2 tablespoons of vinegar per day.\n+ Do NOT take vinegar supplements for more than 3 months straight- switch to maintenance option.19\n+ Do NOT take vinegar if you are at risk for (stomach) cancer, as eating pickled foods is associated with risk of stomach Cancer and do NOT use vinegar if you have an ulcer or reflux.\n+ As vinegar is acidic, If drinking the vinegar, you should chew sugar free gum after the meal (which is another SLOtility technique!), or rinse your mouth with water, or brush your teeth. This will serve to increase salivary flow, which helps to return the acidity levels in the mouth to normal. Other options include: use a dropper for the vinegar to avoid touching teeth; dilute and follow with baking soda; sip through a straw. If you have bad teeth/cavities, use the pills only. If taking the pills, wash down with water- you don’t want the pills to get lodged in your throat!\n+ Vinegar can lower blood sugar- careful if diabetic.\n+ Adverse reactions reported: inflammation of esophagus, and laryngospasm- both of which resolved spontaneously.\n+ Taking 8 ounces per day lead to low potassium and osteoporosis in one report- eat a Potassium-containing food source\nwith the vinegar (see the Potassium SLOtility Diet Xtra Supplement on p. 33 e.g. add a tomato to your salad)\n+ Possible side effects: tooth sensitivity/cavities, bloating/gas/heartburn, low sodium (leg cramp), heightened allergPieasg,e 14\n￼￼hair loss, yeast infection- so don’t drink the whole bottle of vinegar! placeholder_name  2014-01-10 02:18:57.072341  2014-01-10 02:22:18.103868
5 cinnamon  Cinnamon    Cinnamon is a spice obtained from the Cinnamon Tree (ok, it’s from the Cinnamomum tree, but cinnamon is hard enough to spell!). Two common types of cinnamon are cassia and ceylon, although cinnamon powder can be a combination of both. Cinnamon slows food down in the stomach.21 Cinnamonalso lowers blood sugar and cholesterol, so it has the added benefit of reducing risk of diabetes and heart\ndisease. 8 Take 6 grams per day, or 1 1/4 teaspoons (or 1 1/4 sticks- can powderize with a coffee grinder)- can filter into tea- see below Take 1 gram per day. Cinnamon pills can be\nbought online or at brick-and-mortar stores. See links at SLOtility.com Eat oatmeal or yogurt or rice pudding with heavily sprinkled cinnamon + One alert about cinnamon is the risk of coumarin, one of the flavor components which is a higher content in cassia cinnamon. Coumarin can cause liver and kidney damage in high concentrations, so do not consume large amounts of cassia cinnamon. Note Saigon cinnamon is more closely related to cassia. Ceylon cinnamon has a much lower coumarin content and so is preferable. However, most toxins in cinnamon are fat soluble, so you can use a water-soluble extract; or make cinnamon tea (boil the cinnamon in water, run it through a coffee filter and discard the solid filtrate).\n+ Do NOT take more than 6 grams of cinnamon per day- (1 t = 4.75g); or more than .3mg coumarin/kg bodyweight. (coumarin content: 2.65mg/g cinnamon). 25mg coumarin for 1-2 weeks causes toxicity.\n+ Do NOT take cassia cinnamon supplement for greater than 4 months- switch to maintenance option; and do NOT take if you have liver disease or dysfunction.\n+ Do NOT use cinnamon if you develop contact stomatitis (redness, swelling, itching, or pain; like symptoms of an allergic reaction); or if you are pregnant\n+ Do NOT ingest dry cinnamon without liquid- cinnamon powder can be accidentally inhaled and enter the lungs, which can be dangerous\n+ Cinnamon can lower blood sugar- careful if diabetic.\n+ Tell health care provider you are taking.  cinnamon.png  2014-01-10 02:24:43.284255  2014-01-10 02:24:43.284255
