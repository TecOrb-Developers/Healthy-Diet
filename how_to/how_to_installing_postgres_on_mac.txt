Installing PostgreSQL on Mac OS X Mavericks for use with Ruby Rails

Goal: Using Mac OS X, Mavericks 
      Rails developer
      May be using SQLite, but want to move to Postgres 
        because you are deploying to Heroku or another service that uses Postgres and you
        want to match the production database 
      Existing Rails app (dev/slotility) that currently uses sqlite and want to change to postgres database

1. Install postgres locally (using Homebrew)
   % brew postgresql
   If brew not found, install brew (see other docs)

     Test the installation by manually starting up the postgres database engine using:
     % postgres -D /usr/local/var/postgres

   Create a database engine user.  Consider using a generic name such as: postgres_admin
   % createuser postgres_admin

   Make database start automatically upon startup by adding link to Library/LaunchAgents
   % ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/postgresql/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents


2. Install Ruby on Rails "adapter"

   ARCHFLAGS="-arch x86_64" gem install pg
     where ARCHFLAGS setting comes from: brew info postgresql


FOR EACH RAILS APP:

3. Create a database user for the app where the username matches the app's name. 

   % createuser slotility

4. Create development and production databases with the user you just created 
   and a database name that also uses the name of your Rails app.

   % createdb -Oslotility -Eutf8 slotility_development
   % createdb -Oslotility -Eutf8 slotility_test       

   Test that you can connecting to it using app username and app database name.
   % psql -U slotility slotility_development

5. Configure your app (slotility) to use postgres 
 
   Add to Gemfile:
      gem 'pg'

   Edit config/database.yml file to use the newly created username and database name 

    development:
      adapter: sqlite3 CHANGE TO: postgresql
      encoding: unicode
      database: db/development.sqlite3  CHANGE TO: slotility_development
      pool: 5
      ADD: username: slotility
      ADD: password: 

   In your Rails directory, run database setup with:
   % cd dev/slotility
   % rake db:setup

6. Test app
   % rails s
   Show your app in a browser (http://localhost:3000/______)

   Optionally verify the database:
   % psql -U slotility slotility_development
   List all tables:
   => \dt
   Show table definition for YOUR_TABLE_NAME:
   => \d YOUR_TABLE_NAME
   Show table data using SQL:
   => select * from YOUR_TABLE_NAME;

7. Loading data:
   Drop database:
   psql -d 
   psql -d slotility_development -f db/seed_data.sql
